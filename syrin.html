				<h1>Why did I get redirected here?</h1>
				<p>
				  <b>tl;dr</b>: The site can't really be deemed safe until Syrin fixes a bug, but if you <em>really</em> want to visit the site <a href='http://syrin.me/quotes.php#force=true'>click here</a> (but it isn't my fault what might get run in your browser if you continue on)<br><br>
				  
		      <b>Now, for the technical stuff.</b> Pretty much, the bot doesn't escape users' names, nor the quotes themselves, leaving any person who vists the quotelist
		      open to dangerous cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This would allow someone to inject anything from innocent alerts boxes to potentially Bitcoin miners or malware
		      Because of this, and because Syrin is asleep, I made the decision to redirect the site here until he fixes it.
		      
		      To Syrin: All you need to do is delete quote 340, 341, and 338 from the Half-Mast quote list, and then make the bot escape the usernames and quotes that get added to the site.
		      If you have any questions, send me a message on Discord. Sorry if this totally disrupts your site or something, just wanted to take precautions,
		      there are evil people out there.
